# zkLedger-hcs

Abstract â€“ Privacy-Preserving ledgers are Distributed Ledgers designed to preserve confidentiality about the nature of the transactions conducted, including the value, the actors involved, the asset balance on the ledger, as well as the sourcing graph of the assets recorded. zkLedger (1) provided the first system that enables auditing directly from the ledger without the need to reveal keys, use any third-party validator, or generate any trusted setup.
